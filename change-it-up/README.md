 - Description:
Create a function that takes a string as a parameter and does the following, in this order:

1. Replaces every letter with the letter following it in the alphabet (see note below)
1. Makes any vowels capital
1. Makes any consonants lower case

**Note:** 
* the alphabet should wrap around, so `Z` becomes `A`
* in this kata, `y` isn't considered as a vowel.

So, for example the string `"Cat30"` would return `"dbU30"` (`Cat30 --> Dbu30 --> dbU30`)
