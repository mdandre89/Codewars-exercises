 - Description:
You have an 8x8 grid with coordinates ranging from `1` to `8`. The origin `(1, 1)` is in the top left corner. The bottom right corner is `(8, 8)`.

You are given a string as an input which will contain the 2 coordinates in this format: `"(x1 y1)(x2 y2)"`, where `(x1 y1)` represents point `A` and `(x2 y2)` represents point `B`. In the inputs provided, point `A` will always be up and to the left of point `B`. In other words, `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2` will be true for every input.

Your goal is to find out the number of different paths you can take to get from point `A` to point `B` by moving one cell at a time either down or right.


## Example

Given an input of `"(2 3)(3 5)"`, the number of possible paths to get from `A` to `B` is 3.

Possible paths, marked with `x`:
```

x .       x x       . x
x B       . B       . B
