# Background:

You have a starting string of the lowercase alphabet, space-separated:
```python
"a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"
```
Then you are given random **sets** of letters to throw against this string. For example:
```python
{'e', 'B', 'F', 'i'}
```
Whenever there is a match (case sensitive), the letter in the original string is knocked out and replaced by an underscore. Using the random set above as an example would result in:
```python
"a b c d _ f g h _ j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"
```

# Implementation
Write a function ```destroyer(input_sets)``` that takes input as a tuple of one or more of these random character sets and returns the alphabet formatted as shown, with underscores showing where matches knocked out a letter.

For example:
```python
>>> input_sets = ({'A', 'b'}, {'d', 'C', 'b'})
>>> destroyer(input_sets)
>>> "a _ c _ e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"
```
~~~if:rust
In Rust:
```rust
let mut input_set: Vec<HashSet<char>> = Vec::new();
input_set.push(['A', 'b'].iter().cloned().collect());
input_set.push(['C', 'd'].iter().cloned().collect());
destroy(input_set) ->  "a _ c _ e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z"
```
~~~

## Extra credit question:

If the average random set thrown at the lowercase alphabet is ten (10) characters long (same rules as above, uppercase and lowercase letters only), then how many random sets - on average - do you have to throw at the alphabet in order to be left with only underscores?
