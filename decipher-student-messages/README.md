 - Description:
Two students are giving each other test answers during a test. They don't want to be caught so they are sending each other coded messages.

For example one student is sending the following message: `"Answer to Number 5 Part b"`. He starts with a square grid (in this example a 5x5 grid) and he writes the message down, including with spaces:
```
Answe
r to 
Numbe
r 5 P
art b
```

He then starts writing the message down one column at a time, from the top to the bottom. The encoded message is now: `"ArNran u rstm5twob  e ePb"`

You are the teacher of this class. Your job is to decipher the messages and bust the students.


## Task

Complete the function that takes one parameter (the encoded message) and return the original message.

**Note:** The length of the string is always going to be a perfect square.

Have fun !!!
