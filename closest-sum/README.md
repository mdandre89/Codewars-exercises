 - Description:
Given an array (ints) of n integers, find three integers in arr such that the sum is closest to a given number (num), target.

Return the sum of the three integers. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
```ruby
closest_sum([-1, 2, 1, -4], 1) # 2 (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
```

Note: your solution should not modify the input array.
