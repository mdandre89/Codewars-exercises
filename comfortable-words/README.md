 - Description:
A comfortable word is a word which you can type always alternating the hand you type with (assuming you type using a QWERTY keyboard and use fingers as shown in the image below).

That being said, complete the function which receives a word and returns `true` if it's a comfortable word and `false` otherwise.

The word will always be a string consisting of only ascii letters from `a` to `z`.

To avoid problems with image availability, here's the lists of letters for each hand:

* Left: `q, w, e, r, t, a, s, d, f, g, z, x, c, v, b`
* Right: `y, u, i, o, p, h, j, k, l, n, m`


## Examples

```
"yams"  -->  true
"test"  -->  false
```
