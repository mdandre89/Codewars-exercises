 - Description:
If you like Taco Bell, you will be familiar with their signature doritos locos taco. They're very good.


Why can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.


We want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.

***Key***

all vowels (except 'y') = beef

t = tomato

l = lettuce

c = cheese

g = guacamole

s = salsa

  
***NOTE***    
We do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.
  
Ignore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.

Note that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.
