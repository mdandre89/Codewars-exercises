 - Description:
Your task is to make two functions ( `max` and `min`, or `maximum` and `minimum`, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

### Examples (Input -> Output)

```
* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5
```

### Notes

- You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.
