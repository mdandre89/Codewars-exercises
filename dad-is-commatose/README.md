 - Description:
Your dad doesn't really *get* punctuation, and he's always putting extra commas in when he posts. You can tolerate the run-on sentences, as he does actually talk like that, but those extra commas have to go!

Write a function called ```dadFilter``` that takes a string as argument and returns a string with the extraneous commas removed. The returned string should not end with a comma or any trailing whitespace.
