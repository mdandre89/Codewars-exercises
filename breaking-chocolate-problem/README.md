 - Description:
Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension `n` x `m` into small squares.
Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable.
Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size `2` x `1` you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size `3` x `1` you must do two breaks.

If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.
