 - Description:
You have a job interview tomorrow and you need to sound like you know what you are doing. Rent is due and hiding from the bailiffs is getting tiresome.

You devise an ingenious plan to find some big technical sounding words that you plan to spout confidently in front of your employer. 

Write some code that gives you the longest word from a string of words that you aren't too sure of. 

You must return an array containing the biggest word & how many characters it has, e.g. 
"javascript java babel recursion refactorization compiler optimization" would return

```javascript
["refactorization", 15]
```
PS. Only include alphabet characters in the letter count!
