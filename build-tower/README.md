Build Tower
---

Build a pyramid-shaped tower given a positive integer `number of floors`. A tower block is represented with `"*"` character.

For example, a tower with `3` floors looks like this:

```
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
```

And a tower with `6` floors looks like this:

```
[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
```
