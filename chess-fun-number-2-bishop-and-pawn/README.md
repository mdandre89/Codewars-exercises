# Task
 Given the positions of a white `bishop` and a black `pawn` on the standard chess board, determine whether the bishop can capture the pawn in one move.

 The `bishop` has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement. Check out the example below to see how it can move:
